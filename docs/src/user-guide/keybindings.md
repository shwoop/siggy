# Keybindings

siggy uses vim-style modal editing with two modes: **Insert** (default) and
**Normal**. All keybindings are configurable via profiles and per-key overrides.

## Profiles

Three built-in profiles are available:

| Profile | Description |
|---|---|
| **Default** | Vim-style modal editing (Normal / Insert modes) |
| **Emacs** | No modal concept; Ctrl-based shortcuts in Insert mode |
| **Minimal** | Arrow-key centric; F-key shortcuts for actions |

Set the profile in your config file:

```toml
keybinding_profile = "Default"
```

Or switch profiles live in the app via `/keybindings` or `/settings` > Keybindings.

## Customizing keybindings

### Per-key overrides

Create `~/.config/siggy/keybindings.toml` to override individual keys on top
of your active profile:

```toml
[global]
quit = "ctrl+q"

[normal]
scroll_up = "ctrl+j"
react = "ctrl+r"

[insert]
send_message = "ctrl+enter"
```

### Custom profiles

Create full profiles in `~/.config/siggy/keybindings/myprofile.toml`:

```toml
name = "My Custom"

[global]
quit = "ctrl+c"
next_conversation = "tab"

[normal]
scroll_up = "k"
scroll_down = "j"

[insert]
exit_insert = "esc"
send_message = "enter"
insert_newline = ["shift+enter", "alt+enter"]
```

Arrays are supported for binding multiple keys to the same action.

### In-app rebinding

Open the keybindings overlay with `/keybindings` (alias `/kb`). Navigate
actions with `j`/`k`, press Enter to capture a new key, Backspace to reset
to profile default. Changes are saved automatically.

## Default keybindings
