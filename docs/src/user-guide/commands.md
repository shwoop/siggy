typing, the list filters down. Use:

- **Up/Down arrows** to navigate the list

After typing `/join `, a second autocomplete popup shows matching contacts and
groups. Filter by name or phone number. Groups are shown in green. Press Tab to
complete the selection.

## Examples

**Join a conversation by name:**
```
/join Alice
```

**Join by phone number:**
```
/j +15551234567
```

**Toggle direct message notifications off:**
```
/bell direct
```

**Toggle all notifications:**
```
/bell
```

**Mute the current conversation:**
```
/mute
```

**Search for a message:**
```

This opens a file browser. Navigate with `j`/`k`, Enter to select a file or
enter a directory, Backspace to go up. The selected file attaches to your next
message.

## Messaging a new contact

To start a conversation with someone not in your sidebar, use `/join` with their
phone number in E.164 format:

```
/join +15551234567
```

The conversation will appear in your sidebar once the first message is exchanged.
